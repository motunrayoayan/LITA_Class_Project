### Project Title: Types of Data
---

### Overview
---
In data analysis, datasets can be broadly classified into three types: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Each type requires different analytical tools and techniques based on its organization and complexity.

### Structure Data
---
Structured data is highly organized, often stored in tabular formats such as rows and columns (like spreadsheets or databases). Each data point has a clear schema, which makes it easy to search, sort, and analyze. It is typically found in relational databases and spreadsheets.

### Examples
---
- Financial data [Download Here](https://financial.report)
  1. Sales
  2. Revenue
  3. Expenses

- Customer information in databases (names, contact details, purchase history)
- Employee records (name, department, salary, etc.)

### SQL Code
---
```SQL
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE CONDITION = TRUE
```
