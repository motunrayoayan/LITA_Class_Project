### Overview
---
In data analysis, datasets can be broadly classified into three types: structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Each type requires different analytical tools and techniques based on its organization and complexity.

### Structure Data
---
Structured data is highly organized, often stored in tabular formats such as rows and columns (like spreadsheets or databases). Each data point has a clear schema, which makes it easy to search, sort, and analyze. It is typically found in relational databases and spreadsheets.
